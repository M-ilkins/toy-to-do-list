# Personal reminders for project : 

1- The Jocko images need to be made responsive as far as where they are placed/appear
2- The app could use some 'update' functionality as in CRUD (create read update delete)-allow user to click on
text content of li element and edit it without fully deleting the element
3- Add animaton to how the li elements appear and disappear

## Aside/observations : 

1-This very simple toy project that started out as just a "let me mess around with DOM manipulation" quickly became
something that is being pushed to GitHub. I see now the massive importance of having a solid plan or wireframing a concept
then breaking it down into psuedo code step by step by step. This has been a fun toy project, but I see the double edged
sword of having more and more visions and ideas of how I can make it more complex but also the tribulations that come with that-you
can get lost in the weeds fairly quickly without having a broader vision. Lesson: spend more time planning and strategizing, whether
that is Rubber Ducking with Psuedo Code and some wireframing or whatever have a vision and a plan, don't go into it blind-that is sub-optimal.
Obviously things will come up, needs will change, etc you don't want to be too rigid but a good program is a good DESIGNED program i.e there
is a lot of time, energy, and effort spent on the pre-stages before you get into code!
